# google_project

Allows creation and management of a Google Cloud Platform project.

Projects created with this resource must be associated with an Organization. See the Organization documentation for more details.

The service account used to run Terraform when creating a google_project resource must have roles/resourcemanager.projectCreator. See the Access Control for Organizations Using IAM doc for more information.

Note that prior to 0.8.5, google_project functioned like a data source, meaning any project referenced by it had to be created and managed outside Terraform. As of 0.8.5, google_project functions like any other Terraform resource, with Terraform creating and managing the project. To replicate the old behavior, either:

- Use the project ID directly in whatever is referencing the project, using the google_project_iam_policy to replace the old policy_data property.
- Use the import functionality to import your pre-existing project into Terraform, where it can be referenced and used just like always, keeping in mind that Terraform will attempt to undo any changes made outside Terraform.

It's important to note that any project resources that were added to your Terraform config prior to 0.8.5 will continue to function as they always have, and will not be managed by Terraform. Only newly added projects are affected.
